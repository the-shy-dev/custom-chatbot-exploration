## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems designed to understand and generate human-like text. They are trained on massive amounts of text data using deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks. These models learn patterns, grammar, and context, allowing them to answer questions, write essays, generate code, translate languages, and more.

Key points in simple terms:
- **Based on Neural Networks**: LLMs use deep learning (like the brain‚Äôs neurons) to recognize patterns in text.
- **Trained on Huge Data**: They process billions of words from books, articles, and online content to learn language.
- **Can Generate Text**: They predict and create sentences based on the given input.
- **Context Awareness**: They remember previous words and sentences to make responses more meaningful.
- **Used in Many Applications**: Chatbots, coding assistants, content generation, translation, and more.

Let me know if you want a deeper dive into specific aspects!

### **How Are LLMs Trained?**
LLMs are trained through a multi-step deep learning process involving neural networks, massive datasets, and specialized training techniques. The key stages include:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - They are trained on a vast dataset, including books, articles, websites, and code repositories.
   - The data is cleaned to remove harmful, biased, or low-quality content.

2. **Pretraining (Self-Supervised Learning)**  
   - The model learns general language patterns by predicting missing words in a sentence (e.g., "The cat sat on the ___").
   - This is done using a neural network architecture called **Transformers** (e.g., GPT, BERT).

3. **Fine-Tuning**  
   - After pretraining, models are fine-tuned on specific tasks, such as summarization, coding, or legal text processing.
   - They are sometimes trained with **human feedback (RLHF - Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** to improve response quality.

4. **Optimization**  
   - Techniques like **dropout, gradient clipping, and layer normalization** are used to make training efficient.
   - Training is done on **GPUs or TPUs**, which handle massive matrix calculations required for deep learning.

### **What Subset of AI Do LLMs Belong To?**
LLMs are a part of **Deep Learning**, which is a subset of **Machine Learning**, which itself is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. More specifically:
- **AI** ‚Üí Broad field that includes all intelligent systems.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** ‚Üí Algorithms that learn from data.
- **Deep Learning (DL)** ‚Üí Uses deep neural networks for advanced tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ‚Üí A branch of AI focused on understanding human language.
- **Transformers & LLMs** ‚Üí Specialized deep learning models for text-based tasks.

---

### **How Do LLMs Generate Text?**
LLMs generate text using a **probabilistic approach**:
1. **Tokenization**  
   - Text is broken into small units called "tokens" (words or subwords).
   - Example: "Hello, world!" ‚Üí ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"]

2. **Next-Token Prediction**  
   - The model calculates the probability of the next word based on previous words.
   - Example: "The sky is ___" ‚Üí The model predicts "blue" with 85%, "cloudy" with 10%, etc.

3. **Sampling & Decoding**  
   - The model selects the most probable word using strategies like:
     - **Greedy Search** (picks the highest probability word)
     - **Beam Search** (keeps multiple possibilities to optimize output)
     - **Top-k & Nucleus Sampling** (adds randomness for creativity)

4. **Iteration**  
   - The predicted word is added, and the process repeats until the response is complete.

---

### **How Do LLMs Become Context-Aware?**
LLMs use **self-attention mechanisms** and **positional embeddings** to understand and remember context. Here's how:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism (Transformer Model)**
   - Every word in a sentence attends to every other word, understanding relationships.
   - Example: In "She said she loves coffee," the model knows which "she" refers to.

2. **Positional Encoding**
   - Since transformers don‚Äôt process text sequentially, they use **position embeddings** to understand word order.

3. **Long-Context Handling**
   - Advanced LLMs (like GPT-4 or Claude) maintain context over long passages.
   - **Techniques like sliding window attention or memory-efficient attention** help manage longer conversations.

4. **Fine-Tuning with RLHF**
   - Human reviewers provide feedback to improve contextual accuracy in dialogue.

---

### **Summary**
- **Training**: Pretraining on vast text + Fine-tuning with human feedback.
- **AI Subset**: Part of Deep Learning, specifically NLP using Transformers.
- **Text Generation**: Predicts next words using probabilities and sampling techniques.
- **Context Awareness**: Uses self-attention, positional encoding, and long-context management.

### **What Are Parameters in LLMs?**
Parameters in LLMs are the **learnable weights** of the neural network. They control how the model processes and generates text. These parameters include:
- **Weights & Biases**: Adjust the influence of words and phrases.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Decide how words relate to each other.
- **Embeddings**: Represent words numerically for computation.

More **parameters = more complexity**, allowing the model to understand deeper relationships and generate more accurate responses.

### **How Do Parameters Impact Model Efficiency & Performance?**

Parameters are the fundamental building blocks of Large Language Models (LLMs), directly influencing their **accuracy, speed, memory usage, and adaptability**. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Impact on Performance**
More parameters generally improve a model‚Äôs ability to:
‚úÖ **Understand complex language structures** (better grammar, coherence).  
‚úÖ **Generate more contextually relevant responses** (deep reasoning, long-context memory).  
‚úÖ **Handle multi-modal tasks** (text, code, images, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Improve few-shot learning** (learning from small examples).  

üìå **Example:**  
- GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) struggles with long-context dependencies.  
- GPT-4 (estimated 1T parameters) maintains coherence across long essays.  

üî¥ **Downside**: More parameters **don‚Äôt always** mean better real-world performance due to **diminishing returns** beyond a certain point.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Impact on Speed & Latency**
Larger models:
‚è≥ **Take longer to generate responses** (high computational complexity).  
üîã **Consume more power** (GPUs/TPUs work harder).  
üíæ **Require more VRAM** (high-end GPUs like A100, H100, or Cloud TPUs needed).  

üìå **Example:**  
- **Mistral 7B** (small, optimized model) runs on a standard GPU.  
- **GPT-4 (1T estimated parameters)** requires massive clusters of GPUs.  

üî¥ **Optimization Techniques:**
- **Quantization**: Reduces model precision (e.g., from 32-bit to 8-bit floats) to speed up inference.  
- **Pruning**: Removes unnecessary parameters to shrink model size.  
- **Distillation**: A smaller "student" model learns from a large "teacher" model.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Impact on Memory Usage**
- **Large models require more RAM and storage.**  
- **VRAM bottlenecks occur on consumer hardware.**  
- Fine-tuning large models demands **hundreds of GBs of storage.**  

üìå **Example:**  
- **LLaMA 7B** runs on a powerful laptop.  
- **PaLM 2 (540B)** requires a supercomputer.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Trade-off Between Size vs. Efficiency**
| **Model Size**    | **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Small (7B‚Äì13B)**  | Fast, low memory, efficient  | Less nuanced, short memory      |
| **Medium (40B‚Äì65B)** | Balanced performance/speed | Needs high-end GPUs            |
| **Large (100B‚Äì1T)** | Best reasoning, longest memory | Expensive, slow inference       |

üìå **Key Insight**:  
- Small models like **Mistral 7B** are great for **real-time applications**.  
- Large models like **GPT-4 (1T)** excel in **deep analysis but are costly**.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ How Model Scaling Affects Training Cost**
| **Model**  | **Training Cost (Estimated)** |
|------------|------------------------------|
| GPT-2 (1.5B) | $50K‚Äì$100K |
| GPT-3 (175B) | $4M‚Äì$12M |
| GPT-4 (1T) | $50M+ |

üî¥ **Why So Expensive?**  
- **Training takes weeks/months** on thousands of GPUs.  
- **Electricity & cloud costs** scale exponentially.  

üîπ **Optimization Focus** (for companies & researchers):  
‚úÖ Use **smaller, specialized models** instead of monolithic ones.  
‚úÖ Implement **efficient architectures** (e.g., Mixture of Experts, sparse attention).  

---

### **Final Takeaways**

Would you like to dive into **optimizations like quantization, pruning, or distillation** next? üöÄ

### **Optimizations for Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
As models grow in size, running them efficiently becomes a major challenge. Here are the **three main techniques** used to optimize LLMs:  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Quantization (Reducing Precision)**
### üîπ **What is Quantization?**
Quantization reduces the precision of the model‚Äôs weights and activations (from 32-bit floating-point to lower-bit representations like 16-bit, 8-bit, or even 4-bit). This significantly lowers memory usage and speeds up computation.

### üîπ **How It Works**
- Standard models use **FP32 (32-bit floating-point)** precision.
- Quantization converts these to **FP16, INT8, or INT4**, reducing model size without major accuracy loss.
- Faster inference and **lower power consumption**.

### üîπ **Types of Quantization**
| **Type**        | **Description** | **Speed & Memory Gain** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **FP16 (Half Precision)** | Uses 16-bit floating points instead of 32-bit. | üîº Moderate speed-up & memory reduction. |
| **INT8 (Integer 8-bit)** | Converts model weights to 8-bit integers. | üîºüîº Significant speed-up. |
| **INT4 / INT2 (Ultra Low Precision)** | Converts weights to 4-bit or 2-bit for extreme compression. | üîºüîºüîº Maximum efficiency but slight accuracy loss. |

### üîπ **Examples**
- **GPTQ** (GPT Quantization) optimizes **GPT-like models** for faster inference.
- **LLama.cpp** uses **4-bit quantization** to run LLaMA models on consumer hardware.
- **BitsAndBytes (8-bit Adam optimizer)** makes fine-tuning large models feasible.

### üîπ **Pros & Cons**
‚úÖ **Massive reduction in VRAM requirements** (can run 7B models on a 6GB GPU).  
‚úÖ **Speeds up inference on edge devices (laptops, phones).**  
‚ùå **Slight accuracy degradation** (especially in ultra-low precision like INT4).  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pruning (Removing Redundant Weights)**
### üîπ **What is Pruning?**
Pruning removes **unimportant** neurons or weights in the neural network, making the model **smaller and faster** while maintaining similar accuracy.

### üîπ **How It Works**
1. **Identify low-impact weights** that contribute minimally to predictions.
2. **Remove or zero out these weights**.
3. **Fine-tune the model** to recover accuracy after pruning.

### üîπ **Types of Pruning**
| **Type**        | **Description** | **Efficiency Gain** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Unstructured Pruning** | Removes individual low-impact weights across the model. | üîº Memory-efficient but hard to accelerate. |
| **Structured Pruning** | Removes entire neurons or attention heads. | üîºüîº Much faster inference. |
| **Lottery Ticket Hypothesis** | Identifies "winning subnetworks" that work just as well as full models. | üîºüîºüîº Extremely optimized networks. |

### üîπ **Examples**
- OpenAI and DeepMind use **pruning** to optimize massive models like GPT-4.
- **DistilBERT** is a pruned version of BERT, running **60% faster** while keeping **97% of accuracy**.

### üîπ **Pros & Cons**
‚úÖ **Reduces memory & compute usage**.  
‚úÖ **Speeds up inference significantly**.  
‚ùå **Requires retraining** to regain performance.  
‚ùå **Too much pruning can hurt model quality**.  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Distillation (Training Smaller "Student" Models)**
### üîπ **What is Model Distillation?**
Instead of using the full large model, we **train a smaller model (student)** to imitate the **larger teacher model**. The student learns to **mimic the teacher‚Äôs outputs**, reducing model size while maintaining high performance.

### üîπ **How It Works**
1. **Train a large teacher model** (e.g., GPT-4).
2. **Generate soft labels (predictions)** from the teacher.
3. **Train a smaller student model** using these outputs instead of raw data.

### üîπ **Types of Distillation**
| **Type**        | **Description** | **Efficiency Gain** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Knowledge Distillation** | The student model learns from the teacher's probabilities. | üîºüîº Smaller model with high accuracy. |
| **Task-Specific Distillation** | The student is trained only for specific tasks (e.g., summarization, translation). | üîºüîºüîº Best for real-world deployment. |

### üîπ **Examples**
- **DistilGPT-2** ‚Üí A smaller, **faster** version of GPT-2 (~6X smaller, ~3X faster).  
- **TinyBERT** ‚Üí A distilled **version of BERT**, used in mobile NLP applications.  

### üîπ **Pros & Cons**
‚úÖ **Reduces model size without significant accuracy loss**.  
‚úÖ **Works well for mobile and edge applications**.  
‚ùå **Requires an already-trained teacher model**.  
‚ùå **May not generalize as well as the original model**.  

---

## **Comparison of Optimization Techniques**
| **Method**       | **Primary Goal** | **Speed Boost** | **Memory Savings** | **Accuracy Trade-off** |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Quantization** | Reduce precision | üîºüîºüîº | üîºüîºüîº | üîΩ (Minimal for FP16, moderate for INT4) |
| **Pruning** | Remove unnecessary weights | üîºüîº | üîºüîº | üîΩ (Needs retraining) |
| **Distillation** | Train a smaller model | üîºüîºüîº | üîºüîºüîº | üîΩ (Depends on training quality) |

---

## **When to Use Each Optimization?**
| **Use Case** | **Best Optimization Method** |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Running on low-end hardware (e.g., laptops, phones) | **Quantization (4-bit, 8-bit)** |
| Deploying real-time applications | **Distillation** |
| Speeding up inference on a large model | **Pruning** |
| Running models in cloud environments with GPU limits | **Quantization + Pruning** |
| Fine-tuning models with limited VRAM | **8-bit Quantization (BitsAndBytes)** |

---

## **Final Thoughts**
- **Quantization** is best for running models on low-power devices.  
- **Pruning** is useful when **speed matters more than size**.  
- **Distillation** is the most effective **for deploying smaller, efficient models**.  
- Combining **Quantization + Pruning + Distillation** gives the **best balance of efficiency and accuracy**.

## Scaling up a model

Yes, you can **increase your model size in steps** (e.g., **10B ‚Üí 50B ‚Üí 100B ‚Üí 175B**), but there are several important considerations to ensure **efficiency, stability, and scalability** during the process.

---

## **1. Scaling an LLM Step by Step**
Instead of training a **175B parameter model** from scratch, you can:
- **Train a 10B model first** with a high-quality dataset.
- **Expand to 50B and continue training (transfer learning).**
- **Scale up to 100B and then 175B using incremental parameter expansion.**

### **Why Scale in Steps?**
- **Lower Compute Costs Initially:** Training **10B** is much cheaper than jumping to **175B** directly.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Allows you to improve architecture, data quality, and training efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation & Debugging:** Large-scale models require optimizations (weight sparsity, MoE).
- **Avoiding Wasted Compute:** If 10B doesn‚Äôt perform well, you can modify training strategies before committing to 175B.

---

## **2. Key Considerations for Stepwise Scaling**
### **(1) Efficient Training Strategy**
- **Train Smaller Model (10B) First**: Ensure it's well-trained on diverse data.
- **Progressive Expansion**: Scale from **10B ‚Üí 50B ‚Üí 100B** while reusing trained weights.
- **Pre-trained to Fine-tuned Expansion**: Use **low-rank adaptation (LoRA)** or **sparse mixture of experts (MoE)**.

### **(2) Parameter Expansion Techniques**
| **Method**              | **Description**                                      | **Usage** |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Layer Expansion**   | Increase transformer layers from 24 ‚Üí 48 ‚Üí 96+  | Common  |
| **Hidden Size Growth** | Increase embedding dimensions, FFN size       | Common  |
| **Mixture of Experts** | Introduce sparse gating & expert models       | Efficient |
| **Tensor Parallelism** | Use distributed model parallelism              | Necessary |

- Example: If your **10B model** has **48 transformer layers**, you can **double it** to 96 layers for **50B**.

### **(3) Compute Scaling Strategy**
- **10B Model:** Can be trained on **8‚Äì16 A100 GPUs** (~$500K cloud cost).
- **50B Model:** Needs **128+ A100s** (~$2M cloud cost).
- **100B Model:** Requires **512+ GPUs** (~$10M cloud cost).
- **175B Model:** Needs **1024+ GPUs** (~$20M+ cloud cost).

üí° **Best Practice:** Train **smaller models** on cheaper hardware, then transition to **H100s or TPUs for final scaling**.

---

## **3. Can I Reuse Weights from 10B to 50B to 100B?**
Yes! **Weight Initialization & Transfer Learning** are key:
- **Model Expansion Approaches:**
  - **Layer-wise Expansion**: Start with trained **10B layers**, add new **untrained layers**.
  - **Embedding Expansion**: Gradually increase token/hidden dimensions.
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Use trained 10B as a base model for instruction tuning at 50B.

üöÄ **Meta‚Äôs LLaMA-2 (7B, 13B, 65B)** & OpenAI‚Äôs GPT series **use similar scaling approaches.**

---

## **4. Cost Comparison: Scaling vs. Full Training**
| **Model Size**  | **Training Compute** | **Full Training Cost (Cloud, AWS/Google TPU)** | **Incremental Scaling Cost** |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **10B**       | ~8 A100 GPUs    | **$500K - $1M**                 | N/A                     |
| **50B**       | ~128 A100 GPUs  | **$2M - $5M**                   | ~$1.5M - $3M            |
| **100B**      | ~512 A100 GPUs  | **$10M+**                        | ~$4M - $7M              |
| **175B**      | ~1024 A100 GPUs | **$20M+**                        | ~$8M - $12M             |

**Scaling is generally cheaper** than training a 175B model from scratch.

---

## **5. Final Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Yes, you can scale in steps!**  
‚úÖ **Start with 10B, then 50B, 100B, 175B, etc.**  
‚úÖ **Use model parallelism (Tensor/Zero3, Mixture of Experts) to optimize costs.**  
‚úÖ **Incremental expansion is cheaper & efficient** than training from scratch.  

Would you like me to **recommend a specific scaling plan** based on **your available resources**? üöÄ

## Breaking down a bigger model into smaller models

Yes, you **can create a smaller model from a larger one**, and this process is known as **Model Distillation** or **Pruning & Compression**. This is useful for **reducing computational costs, improving inference speed, and deploying models on edge devices.**

---

## **1. Techniques to Create a Smaller Model from a Larger One**
Here are the **three main approaches**:

### **(1) Knowledge Distillation (KD)**
- **How it works**: Train a smaller **student model** to mimic a larger **teacher model**.
- **Steps**:
  1. Train the large model (e.g., **175B**).
  2. Generate outputs (logits, embeddings, or attention scores) from the large model.
  3. Train a **smaller model** (e.g., **50B** or **10B**) using these soft labels instead of raw dataset labels.

‚úÖ **Pros**:
- The student model learns richer representations.
- Can match or even outperform training a small model from scratch.

üöÄ **Example**:
- GPT-3 **175B ‚Üí GPT-3 Small 6.7B** (OpenAI)
- BERT **base (110M) ‚Üí TinyBERT (4.4M)**

---

### **(2) Model Pruning**
- **How it works**: Remove **less important parameters or neurons** from the large model.
- **Types**:
  - **Unstructured pruning**: Remove individual weights (e.g., set them to zero).
  - **Structured pruning**: Remove entire **neurons, layers, or attention heads**.

‚úÖ **Pros**:
- Reduces model size **without significant performance loss**.
- Works well when combined with quantization.

üöÄ **Example**:
- SparseGPT (Meta) reduces **GPT-3 175B to 70% fewer parameters with minimal accuracy loss**.

---

### **(3) Quantization**
- **How it works**: Reduce **floating-point precision** (e.g., **FP32 ‚Üí INT8 or INT4**).
- **Benefits**:
  - Significantly reduces **memory footprint**.
  - Speeds up **inference** on CPUs & lower-end GPUs.

‚úÖ **Pros**:
- Works well for **LLMs on edge devices** (e.g., LLaMA-2 7B on mobile).

üöÄ **Example**:
- GPTQ & AWQ (used for **LLaMA 2 compression**).

---

## **2. How Much Can You Compress a Model?**
| **Compression Technique** | **Size Reduction** | **Performance Drop?** | **Use Case** |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Distillation** | 50% - 90% smaller | Minimal (~1-3%) | Efficient LLM training |
| **Pruning** | 30% - 70% smaller | Small to medium | Large-scale deployments |
| **Quantization (INT8)** | 75% smaller | ~1-2% | Mobile/low-power devices |
| **Quantization (INT4)** | 90% smaller | Noticeable | Ultra-fast inference |

---

## **3. Real-World Examples**
| **LLM Model** | **Original Size** | **Smaller Version** | **Reduction** | **Method** |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| GPT-3 | 175B | GPT-3 Small (6.7B) | **96%** | Knowledge Distillation |
| LLaMA-2 | 65B | LLaMA-2 13B | **80%** | Pruning + Distillation |
| BERT | 340M | DistilBERT (66M) | **80%** | Knowledge Distillation |
| T5 | 11B | T5-Small (60M) | **99%** | Knowledge Distillation |
| Falcon | 180B | Falcon-40B | **78%** | Structured Pruning |

## Computing requirements

### **Max Model Size You Can Train on an RTX 3090**
The **NVIDIA RTX 3090** has **24GB of VRAM**, which **severely limits the maximum LLM size** you can train. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **what‚Äôs possible** on your PC.

---

## **1. Memory Constraints: How Many Parameters Can Fit?**
### **Formula to Estimate Max Model Size**
Each **model parameter** (FP16) takes **2 bytes**, and LLMs use **multiple copies** of the model (optimizer states, gradients, activations), requiring **‚âà10x model size** in VRAM.

\[
\text{VRAM Required} = \text{Parameters} \times 2 \times 10 \text{ (for training)}
\]

| **Model Size** | **Raw Size (FP16)** | **Total VRAM Required (Training)** | **Can Fit in RTX 3090 (24GB)?** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **1B**      | **2GB**         | **20GB**                 | ‚úÖ **Yes** |
| **2B**      | **4GB**         | **40GB**                 | ‚ùå **No** |
| **3B**      | **6GB**         | **60GB**                 | ‚ùå **No** |
| **7B (LLaMA 2-7B)**  | **14GB**        | **140GB**                | ‚ùå **No** |
| **13B (LLaMA 2-13B)** | **26GB**        | **260GB**                | ‚ùå **No** |
| **GPT-3 (175B)** | **350GB**       | **3.5TB**                | ‚ùå **Impossible** |

üí° **Takeaway**:  
üëâ **Max trainable model size ‚âà 1B parameters** on a single RTX 3090.  
üëâ **Bigger models require multi-GPU setups or offloading.**

---

## **2. How to Train Larger Models?**
If you want to train beyond **1B**, use the following strategies:

### **(1) Offloading (CPU + GPU)**
- Move part of the model **(weights, optimizer states, activations)** to **CPU RAM**.
- Example: **DeepSpeed Zero-Offload, BitsAndBytes, PyTorch FSDP**.
- Can **train up to ~3B models** on a **RTX 3090 + 64GB RAM**.

üí° **Example:**  
- **RTX 3090 + 64GB RAM** ‚Üí Can train a **2-3B model** using **DeepSpeed Zero-Offload**.

---

### **(2) Multi-GPU Training (Data & Model Parallelism)**
- Use **multiple RTX 3090 GPUs** (e.g., **two 3090s = 48GB VRAM**).
- **Tensor parallelism (Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed, FSDP)** allows models to span **multiple GPUs**.
- **Supports ~6B models** with **two 3090s**.

üí° **Example:**  
- **2x RTX 3090 (48GB)** ‚Üí Can train a **6B model**.

### **(3) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) & Quantization**
- Instead of training full models, **fine-tune pre-trained models**.
- Use **4-bit / 8-bit quantization (QLoRA, GPTQ, AWQ)**.
- Can fine-tune **LLaMA-2 7B on 24GB VRAM**.

üí° **Example:**  
- **Fine-tuning LLaMA-2 7B** using **QLoRA** on **RTX 3090** works **fine**.
